# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, I basically sat down with a bunch of tables like customers, sales, products and said  "Alright, tell me what’s actually going on here". With a lot of JOINs, CTEs, and late night debugging, I turned rows of data into real insights about revenue and customer behavior and made sure the queries ran fast enough to not test my patience.
